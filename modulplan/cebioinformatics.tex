{The course teaches pharmaceutical basics such as pharmacodynamics, protein-protein interactions, and molecular dynamics. Computational screening procedures to identify LEAD structures with force fields and in-silico HTS methods are introduced. These techniques are applied in excercises and a group project, where ligands for a receptor molecule have to be identified via docking.}
{The students have advanced knowledge in bioinformatics and can apply it. The qualifications attained in the relevant events for this module (e.g. Structure-based Drug Design) allow students to study a bioinformatics topic in greater detail and thus develop their professional knowledge. In addition, they have had the opportunity to improve their communication skills and their ability to work in small groups.}
