{Topics are among others algebra (groups, rings, fields, polynomial rings, minor classes and theorem of Lagrange) and linear algebra (vector spaces, linear maps and their matrix representation, rank of a matrix, basal changes, orthonormal bases, systems of linear equations and their solution by Gaussian algorithm, determinant, eigenvectors), as well as eigenvalues, orthogonal and symmetric matrices.}
{Students gain knowledge about algebraic structures and linear algebra and their applications in computer science. They are able to argue about abstract algebraic structures and can correctly apply the methods and algorithms of linear algebra for solving linear systems of equations and describing geometric facts. According to this module, the students have certainty in the formally correct mathematical reasoning and their presentation.}
