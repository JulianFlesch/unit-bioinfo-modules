{\paragraph{Lecture Animal Physiology (Neurobiology):} For animals and humans, connections between structure and function at the level of tissues, organs and complex organ systems and their relevance for the emergence of behavior in animals are presented. The focus is on general principles of physiology. The question of the adaptation value of certain construction-function relationships is also posed in comparative considerations. The mediation of specific physiological learning approaches takes precedence over the mediation of matter following to the motto: teaching key concepts is better than touching a broad but shallow spectrum.
\paragraph{Laboratory Excercise Biomolecules and Cell:}  Animal Physiological Course for Bioinformatics. Topics: Reflexes, transmission of SAPs through nerves, muscles, auditory perception. }
{The students know the basics of animal physiology. In practical experiments, they have acquired basic laboratory skills. Since the laboratory is conducted in group, the students extend their constructive criticism and discussion skills.}
