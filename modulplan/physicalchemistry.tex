{180 h}
{\paragraph{Lecture Physical Chemistry:} The basics of thermodynamics (state functions, laws, gas laws, equilibria, phase transitions and phase diagrams), electrochemistry (thermodynamics, EMF, Nernst equation, electrode types, transport processes), reaction kinetics (role in thermodynamics, reaction order, laws of time, equilibrium reactions), and the spectroscopy (electro-magnetic radiation, particles / wave, Termschemata, particles in the box, quantization, vibration, absorption, fluorescence) mediated.  \paragraph{Laboratory work:} After the lecture period, selected experiments highlight the basic concepts of physical chemistry in two weeks of laboratory work.}
{Students know basic principles and techniques of physical chemistry. They know the practical application of these concepts. They have experience with chemical work in the laboratory and are familiar with laboratory safety.}
