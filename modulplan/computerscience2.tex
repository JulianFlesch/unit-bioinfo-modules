{Modeling data, concept of classes, composition and union of class references, class hierarchies, object-oriented modeling and programming, functional methods, encapsulation of state, abstract classes, visibility and access rights, imperative methods, GUI programming, ModelView controller pattern, visitor pattern, debugging.}
{The students know methods and tools of object-oriented modeling and programming and can use them properly. They recognize the characteristics of stateful programming and understand the need to encapsulate state. Basic algorithms and data structures of computer science can be implemented and tested by the study imimperative style. They are ready to leverage their programming skills in subsequent larger projects.}
