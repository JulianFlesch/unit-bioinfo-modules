It deals with the organization of genes in the genome, selected mechanisms of gene regulation and the principles of developmental genetics. It explains the methods used by molecular cell biology and molecular genetics.}
{The students can observe and reproduce biological phenomena in detail, identify and describe organisms, create scientific records, analyze and interpret measurement and test results, adequately select subject-specific techniques, document measurement and test results, and communicate biological issues. They have proven to understand scientific contexts, work critically and develop a sound professional judgment. During the laboratory excercise they have worked in a team.}
