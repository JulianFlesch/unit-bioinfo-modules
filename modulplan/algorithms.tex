{Introduction: Computational models, efficiency measures. Sorting methods: quicksort, heap sort, mergesort. Elementary data structures: lists, trees, graphs, dynamic search structures, hashing. Graph algorithms: screening, shortest paths, spanning trees. Algorithms on strings. Pattern search}
{The students have basic knowledge of basic data structures in computer science as well as algorithms for basic problems. In this content, they are capable of independent creative development of algorithms and data structures. The students know the interactions between data structures and algorithms and can apply these to specific examples. With the analytical techniques learned, they can evaluate simple algorithmic approaches according to their quality, efficiency and complexity.}
