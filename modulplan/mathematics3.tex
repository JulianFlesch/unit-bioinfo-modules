{270 h}
{Topics are among others multidimensional analysis, Fourier series, optimization (extreme value problems under constraints, Lagrangian multipliers, algorithms in discrete and continuous optimization), topics from discrete mathematics such as number theory with applications in cryptology}
{The students gain knowledge in multidimensional analysis, number theory and their application in cryptology and optimization. After successfully finishing this module, they are able to establish relationships between different mathematic branches and name their importance for computer science.}
{Mathematics I and II recommended}
